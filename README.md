# The Renaissance Games repository
Hi! This is the GitHub repository for Enactus Cambridge's "*Renaissance Games*" project. We will mostly be using it as a `linktree`, to keep track of all the different directories and drives. We can also use it for some data (e.g. `excel` spreadsheets) or code storage, if need be.

For now, I will mostly post links here and some draft documents (e.g. proposal).

**Links:**
* [Enactus Cambridge Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0AIH0sHEzBK5fUk9PVA)
* [Week-To-Week plan Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13SqEoJHWeSWTjnXNaI0Owhu8M24S-bqkdwMtGeHTPyw/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Zoom meeting](https://zoom.us/j/6841293849?pwd=OEVYTzliUEdXcUNSV3pabWo2RzRvQT09)

### Tasks
We can also use this to list tasks:
- [ ] Create week-to-week plan
- [ ] Create budget for pilot
- [ ] Look into DBS and use the update service where necessary
- [ ] Look into the areas of deprivation Index to help target schools.
