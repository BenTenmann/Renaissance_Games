# The Renaissance Games repository
Hi! This is the GitHub repository for Enactus Cambridge's "*Renaissance Games*" project. We will mostly be using it as a `linktree`, to keep track of all the different directories and drives. We can also use it for some data (e.g. `excel` spreadsheets) or code storage, if need be.

For now, I will mostly post links here and some draft documents (e.g. proposal).
